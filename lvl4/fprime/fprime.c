//Prime factors: Numbers that only factor is 1 and itself

// Get positive int from user (input is always valid)
// Change num into an integer
// Declare pFactor counter int to value of 2
// Find first prime factor of the int and print
// Equal pFactor to 2
// Find first prime factor of the result of num / firstPrime
// Print '*' followed by the new prime factor
// Do this until you get to a number thats only prime factor is itself and print
